# Forest-Cover-Type-Prediction
Kaggle competition link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-prediction

The objective of this project is to predict the forest cover type based on geographical and geological features. <br />
· Extensive exploration of the dataset<br />
· Feature engineering to create meaningful combinations of the distance measurements <br />
· Various classification algorithms were tested before deciding that RandomForest and ExtraTrees are the best classifiers for this problem <br />
· GridSearch was utilized to find the best hyperparameters for these models<br />
· The final model uses ExtraTreesClassifer and achieved a cross-validated accuracy of 82.6%.

Result: Top 100 on the Kaggle leaderboard
